Traffic Light Controller
===================

By Thomas Tran <ttrann@umich.edu>

## Longer Description
This project focuses on designing a traffic light controller for a four-way intersection. The goal is to manage traffic flow based on various traffic sensors and control lights with a Verilog state machine. The complexity of this project mimics real-world traffic control scenarios, requiring careful analysis of traffic patterns and controller design to ensure smooth traffic movement.
